Working with my master thesis advisor `Professor Whitehill`_, I pursued the task of finding evidence to the claims made in academic papers.

Time Series
~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of a `research group`_ at WPI, we developed a series of theoretical frameworks for time series analysis and search. We further implemented effiecient systems demonstrating these concepts. The focus of our team's research was to leverage a conditional triangle inequality between dynamic time warping and euclidean distance to build a highly accurate and fast system for searching through time series datasets. More information can be found in our `website`_.
