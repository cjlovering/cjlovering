    <p>This site maintains some notes on papers I have read. Presenting material so that others understand is the best way for me to improve my understanding.  For some papers, there are existing explications. However, the process of looking at these papers helps me understand them better, and might afford others another persepective.</p>

        <p>The design and markup is entirely replicated from <a href="https://distill.pub/journal/">distill</a>. After several renditions, I have landed this approach. Previously, I used Sphinx. The two main reasons I tried using Sphinx was that I was able to render jupyter notebooks and I had hoped the raw markup of .rst would be more natural to read and write. However, it ended up being both overly constricting and underwhelming at the same time.</p>
        <p>I use Adobe XD CC for diagrams, D3 for visualizations, and PyTorch and Torch (Lua) for implementations.<p>
