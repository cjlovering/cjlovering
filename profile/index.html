    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>I am pursuing my PhD at Brown Univeristy (2018) working with my advisor <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/index.html">Professor Pavlick</a>.</p>

    <h3>Natural Language Understanding</h3>
    <p>Working with my master thesis advisor <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/jrwhitehill">Professor Whitehill</a>, I pursued the task of finding evidence to the claims made in academic papers.</p>

    <h3>Time Series</h3>
    <p>As part of a research group at WPI, we developed a series of theoretical frameworks for time series analysis and search. We further implemented effiecient systems demonstrating these concepts. The focus of our team's research was to leverage a conditional triangle inequality between dynamic time warping and euclidean distance to build a highly accurate and fast system for searching through time series datasets.
