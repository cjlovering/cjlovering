        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p> I am interested in natural language understanding and reinforcement learning.</p>
        <p>In particular, I study
            emergent communication and feature representations.</p>

        <h2>Academics</h2>
        <h3>Doctorate, 2018+ - Natural Language Understanding </h3>
        <p>I am pursuing my PhD at Brown University (2018) working with <a
                href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/index.html">Professor Pavlick</a>.</p>

        <h3>Masters, 2017-18 - Natural Language Understanding</h3>
        <p>Working with my master thesis advisor <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/jrwhitehill">Professor
                Whitehill</a> we developed machine learning models to find (extract) evidence for claims made in
            academic papers.</p>

        <h3>Undergraduate, 2016-18 - Time Series Analysis</h3>
        <p>As part of a research group at WPI, we developed a series of theoretical frameworks for time series analysis
            and search. We further implemented efficient systems demonstrating these concepts. The focus of our team's
            research was to leverage a conditional triangle inequality between dynamic time warping and euclidean
            distance to build a highly accurate and fast system for searching through time series data sets. More
            information can be found in our <a href="https://c2research.github.io/onex-website/#"></a>website.</p>
