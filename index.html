    <h3 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h3>
    <p>The design and markup is replicated from <a href="https://distill.pub/journal/">distill</a>.</p>
    <p>After several renditions, I have landed on this approach. Previously, I used Sphinx, rst, and jupyter notebooks. The two main reasons I tried using Sphinx was that I was able to directly render jupyter notebooks and I had hoped the raw markup of .rst would be more natural to read and write. However, in the end jupyter notebooks can be very useful, but I don't think they are the best medium for exposition. Furthermore, the rst ends up becoming overly complex when trying to import visualizations, code, etc. Clearly, creating the expositions with raw html is less natural -- but favorably trades effort for control and flexibility.</p>
    <p>I use Adobe XD CC for diagrams, D3 for visualizations, and PyTorch and Torch (Lua) for implementations.<p>
