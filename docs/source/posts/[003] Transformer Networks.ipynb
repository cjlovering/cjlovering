    "A encoder-decoder [structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) is used: an input sequence of symbols, $x = { x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n }$, is encoded into a sequence of continuous variables,  $\\mathbf{z} = { z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_n }$. This is then decoded into a sequence of symbols, $y = { y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n }$. This generation occurs one at a time - it is [auto-regressive](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850), further consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. Encoder and decoder models usually use a recurrent architecture."
